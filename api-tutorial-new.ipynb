    "## Introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore how to use OpenAI Large Language Models (LLMs) using OpenAI API.\n",
    "\n",
    "**OpenAI API** gives developers access to the state-of-the-art LLMs via Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Curently, OpenAI has 2 flagship models:\n",
    "1. **GPT-4o** - the most powerful model with high reasoning.\n",
    "2. **GPT-4o Mini** - the cheapest and fastest model but less \"smart\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use GPT-4o when:\n",
    "- You need high reasoning (logical, analytical tasks).\n",
    "- You build AI solutions with the AI Agents.\n",
    "- The slower responses are not a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, GPT-4o Mini is probably a better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll use only GPT-4o Mini. But I'll show you how to use GPT-4o too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the AI models is quite straightforward. It also has advantages over using tools such as ChatGPT:\n",
    "- Access to models parameters.\n",
    "- Access to the system prompt.\n",
    "- Ability to connect models.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it gives higher customization and control options.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll go through the following topics:\n",
    "- Using GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini via OpenAI API.\n",
    "- The importance of the system prompt.\n",
    "- Streaming responses.\n",
    "- The detailed explanation of tokens.\n",
    "- The practical applications of temperature.\n",
    "And more!\n",
    "\n",
    "To successfully run the notebook, you need to install several packages:\n",
    "- **OpenAI API**: `openai` - the library to use OpenAI models via API calls.\n",
    "- **Python Dotenv**: `python-dotenv` - to load secret variables from the .env file.\n",
    "- **Tiktoken**: `tiktoken `- for counting tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install them, run the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pip install openai python-dotenv tiktoken\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Cost management** - Tokens directly influence the cost of API usage.\n",
    "2. **Billing accuracy** - Token counting enables accurate usage-based billing for customers.\n",
    "3. **Performance optimization** - The number of tokens affects model performance. Monitoring token usage helps optimize prompts.\n",
    "4. **Customer transparency** - Providing real-time token usage data to customers through dashboards helps them control their spending and avoid unexpected costs.\n",
    "5. **Product optimization** - Analyzing token usage patterns can provide insights into how customers are using the AI product, informing future improvements and feature development.\n",
    "6. **Compliance and security**-  Monitoring token usage can help detect unusual patterns that might indicate security issues.\n",
    "7. **Profitability analysis** - By attributing token usage to specific customers or features, companies endure profitability."
